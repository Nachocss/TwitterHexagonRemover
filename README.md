# Web browser extension - Twitter's Hexagon Remover
This web browser extension automatically replaces Twitter's hexagon-shaped frames of profile pictures with the classic round-shaped frame by changing the CSS property 'clip-path'.

It has been tested in Chrome and Opera GX. It should run in other chromium based web browsers.

## Should I use it
Twitter's new feature of differentiating users who buy NFT profiles seems to encourage classism among users of an already overly polarised social network.

If you agree with this, this extension gets this new feature out of the way so you can continue to enjoy Twitter as it was before.

## Automatic installation
This extension is being reviewed for publishing in [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) and [Opera Addons](https://addons.opera.com)

In the meanwhile, you can proceed with a manual installation.
